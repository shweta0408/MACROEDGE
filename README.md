## 📐 How the Models Work

### Regime Detection Engine
Uses a **rule-based scoring system** across 5 macro indicators:

| Indicator | Signal Logic |

| GDP Growth | >2.5% → Bull (+3), <0% → Bear (+3) |
| CPI Inflation | >5% → Stagflation (+3), 2–4% → Bull (+2) |
| Fed Funds Rate | >4.5% → Bear (+2), <2% → Bull (+2) |
| Yield Spread | Negative → Bear (+3) (inverted yield curve) |
| Unemployment | <4.5% → Bull (+2), >6% → Bear (+2) |

The regime with the **highest total score** is declared the active regime.

### Risk Score (0–100)
Composite of: Inflation (max 25pts) + Fed Rate (20pts) + GDP contraction (15pts) + Yield inversion (15pts) + Unemployment (15pts) + VaR proxy (10pts)

### Allocation Engine
Base regime allocations are **scaled by risk profile**:
- Conservative: Reduces equity exposure by 40%, increases bonds
- Moderate: Base regime weights
- Aggressive: Increases equity exposure by 40%, reduces bonds
